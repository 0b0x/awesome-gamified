Awesome Gamified is a project with the idea of turning awesome lists like awesome-mental-health and awesome-programming into gamified experiences. 

### :eyeglasses: Running Awesome Gamified locally

As the project says, just follow the 1-2-3! That is, type the three commands below in your favorite command-line interface and you will be good to go. :smile:

1. Clone this repository locally: `git clone git@github.com:carolinaknoll/awesome-gamified.git`
2. Inside the repository's directory, install Awesome Gamified's dependencies: `npm i`
3. Now, all that's left is to start the engines! Finally, start up the project by running: `npm start`

Now, the project should automatically open on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you will be able to see it and perform your desired changes. 

### :eyeglasses: Contributing

The idea of this project is to find and develop creative ways to save, quantify and display progress on the various topics inside each Awesome list.

If you would like to help (and I will appreciate if you do!) and have different ideas other than the ones already implemented, please create an issue with your sugestion, a pull request or a code review. All feedback is welcome! :smile:

Thank you for taking your time to contribute! :bowtie:
