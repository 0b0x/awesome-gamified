### Awesome Gamified
:eyeglasses: Awesome Gamified - See your progress and save awesome links you've already seen!

***

Awesome Gamified is a project with the idea of turning awesome lists like awesome-mental-health and awesome-programming into gamified experiences. 

#### Contribute
The idea of this project is to find and develop creative ways to save, quantify and display progress on the various topics inside each Awesome list. There are functionalities I would like to develop on my own, these being saving the links already seen inside the Awesome `readme` files and being able to show them on a new screen for easy access.

If you would like to help (and I will appreciate if you do!) and have different ideas other than the ones above, please create an issue with your sugestion or a code review.

Thank you for taking your time to contribute! :bowtie:
